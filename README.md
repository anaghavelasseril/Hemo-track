to develop a comprehensive blood bank monitoring system using IoT 
technologies, including NRF modules for wireless communication and load cell sensors for 
precise stock measurement. Leveraging Node-RED for data processing and visualization,
alongside a user-friendly HTML interface, our system provides real-time monitoring and 
remote access to blood stock information. By integrating these technologies, healthcare 
facilities can streamline blood stock management processes, improve inventory accuracy, 
prevent shortages, and enhance patient care and safety
